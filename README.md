# Joel Christner

Thank you for visiting my Github profile.  I'm an open source developer and member of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/) focused on distributed systems, data storage, information search and retrieval, data management, and messaging.  Outside of coding, I'm a husband, father to two wonderful children, a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt, and a musician.

If you've found value in the software I've published and wish to support me, please consider sponsoring me on Github or [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/joelchristner).
