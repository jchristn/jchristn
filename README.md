Thank you for visiting my Github profile.  I'm an open source developer focused on distributed systems, data storage, information search and retrieval, data management, and messaging.  Outside of coding, I'm a husband, father to two wonderful children, a practitioner and instructor of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and a musician.
